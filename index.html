      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm 28 years old. I love learning.</p>
      <p>I'm a licensed professional in my current field, and, after seperating from my business partner of the last 3 years, I've decided, finally, to do the learning and work necessary to become a full-time Developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>St. Petersburg, Florida</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>
        <ul>
        <li>Enjoy great food and coffee</li>
        <li>Riding my Bike</li>
        <li>Spending time with my Partner and Cat</li>
        <li>Learn new programming languages!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>A loaded question for someoning just changing careers!</p>
      <p>Since we are <i>dreaming</i> I'd say, being a Lead Developer on a start-up project that I cared deeply about.</p>
      <p>That road starts here!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Still, St. Petersburg, Florida!</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>It's what I've wanted to do since I was a kid.</p>
      <p>I taught myself HTML, CSS and a bit of PHP in middle school, 
        even going as far as to asking my dad to buy me a domain name so I could create a WordPress 
        blog for myself. Life happend, my interests shifted, and I ended up 
        on a career track that is entirely uncreative, leaving me unfulfilled and unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>That was at least 13 years ago, so I am picking up where I left off, and not looking back.</p>
